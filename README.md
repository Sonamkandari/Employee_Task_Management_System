## 🚀 Employee Management System

### 🔐 Login Page
- I started by designing the **Login Page**, which allows users to log in using their **email and password**.
- I used **React's `useState` hook** and other functions to manage the form state and submission logic.
- This component handles basic validation and logs form data upon submission.

### 🛠 Admin Dashboard
- After completing the login functionality, I built the **Admin Dashboard** component.
- The first part of the dashboard is the **Header**, which I created as a separate reusable component.
- I stored the `Header.jsx` file inside a folder named `MainComponents` for better project structure.

### 🧩 Header Component Preview
Here is a preview of the Header component used in the Admin Dashboard:
