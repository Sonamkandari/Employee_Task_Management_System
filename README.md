## 🚀 Employee Management System

### 🔐 Login Page
- I started by designing the **Login Page**, which allows users to log in using their **email and password**.
- I used **React's `useState` hook** and other functions to manage the form state and submission logic.
- This component handles basic validation and logs form data upon submission.

### 🛠 Admin Dashboard
- After completing the login functionality, I built the **Admin Dashboard** component.
- The first part of the dashboard is the **Header**, which I created as a separate reusable component.
- I stored the `Header.jsx` file inside a folder named `MainComponents` for better project structure.

### 🧩 Header Component Preview
Here is a preview of the Header component used in the Admin Dashboard:

- similarly to Header,jsx I stored the `TaskListNumbers.jsx` file inside a folder named `MainComponents` for better project structure.

--now e are writing the logic for connecting these component with eavch other 
-- if we used react then it will work in a sequnce logic for egxample 1 person send data to another person but in this case we are using context api here data is centeralized which means who ever needs the data that will request to the center ask for the data
