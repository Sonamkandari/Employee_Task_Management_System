# Employee Management System (EMS)

A React-based Employee Management System that supports secure user authentication, role-based dashboards, task management with status tracking, and centralized state management via React Context API. Data is persisted in browser `localStorage` for seamless offline and reload experiences. The UI features a modern, consistent design using Tailwind CSS.

## üöÄ Project Overview

EMS is a web application designed for efficient employee task management and admin control featuring:

- Distinct login authentication for employees and admins  
- Admin dashboard for creating and monitoring tasks across the team  
- Employee dashboard for viewing and updating individual task statuses  
- Task status lifecycle: New, Accepted, Completed, Failed  
- Centralized, global state managed by React Context API  
- Persistent storage using browser LocalStorage  
- Responsive UI components with fixed-size task cards and gradient styling

## üì¶ Features

- **User Authentication:**  
  - Role distinction between Admins and Employees with separate dashboards and functionality.  
- **Task Management:**  
  - Admins create tasks assigned to employees, categorized by status.  
  - Employees can accept, complete, fail, or delete tasks.  
- **Reusable Task Components:**  
  - Fixed width/height cards with colorful gradient backgrounds:  
    - NewTask (Indigo to Purple)  
    - AcceptTask (Red to Amber)  
    - CompleteTask (Green shades)  
    - FailedTask (Purple to Indigo)  
- **State Centralization:**  
  - React Context API manages global user and task data.  
- **LocalStorage Integration:**  
  - Persistent session and data storage.  
- **Consistent and Responsive UI:**  
  - Tailwind CSS facilitates responsiveness and uniform card sizing.

## üõ† Core Components

### 1. AuthenticationProvider (React Context)

- Centralizes authentication, login/logout, and session persistence.  
- Provides global state flags like `user`, `isAdmin`.  
- Validates credentials using data from LocalStorage.

### 2. Task Cards Components

- Uniform sized (w-80 h-80), consistent design with gradients per task status.  
- Truncation (`line-clamp-3`) used for overflow text control.  
- Centered, styled buttons per card type.

### 3. Main Components

- `Header.jsx`: A shared header for dashboards.  
- `TaskListNumbers.jsx`: Shows task summary statistics.
